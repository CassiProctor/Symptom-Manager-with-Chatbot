# Symptom-Manager-with-Chatbot

Symptom Manager with Chat Care is an app where one may have a conversation with a chatbot who helps them determine if they should go to their primary care doctor, urgent care, or emergency department based on their symptoms and vital signs shared through a series of health questions.

This project will introduce a symptom checker chatbot application for mobile devices and computers. Individuals using this application will be asked health-related questions prompting them to provide their symptoms. This chatbot application will respond with recommendations on what the individual needs to do when they submit their symptoms, including precautionary measures in the meantime. Recommendations will consist of possible diagnosis or advise the individuals to go to visit one of the three health centers: primary care doctor, urgent care, or emergency department.

The purpose of this app is to help both patients and physicians alike. Patientâ€™s are allocated to the right care center depending on the severity of their case. Physicians are then able to properly care for the right patients, as different facilities have different capabilities.
