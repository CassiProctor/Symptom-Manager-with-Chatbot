# Symptom-Manager-with-Chatbot
#Symptom Manager with Chatbot is an app that one may have a conversation with a chatbot who helps them determine if they should go to their primary care doctor, urgent care, or emergency department based on their symptoms, vital signs, and health questions.
#This project introduces a user-friendly symptom checker chatbot designed for both mobile devices and computers.  The chatbot will engage users through health-related questions, prompting them to input and describe their symptoms.  The chatbot application will provide possible diagnosis or conditions, tips for managing minor symptoms, and guidance to seek medical attention.  The goal of the chatbot is to provide quick health guidance and help users to make decisions when feeling unwell.
